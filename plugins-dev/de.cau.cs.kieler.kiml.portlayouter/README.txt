\______________________________________

This layout provider works around some current limitations of the
Random KEG Diagram wizard concerning ports. The layout provider
iterates over all nodes and usually places input ports on the left
side, and output ports on the right side. There is a configurable
probability of placing input and output ports on odd sides, as well
as on the northern and southern side.
