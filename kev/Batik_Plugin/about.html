  What is it?
  -----------

  Batik is a Java based toolkit for applications which handle
  images in the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format for
  various purposes, such as viewing, generation or
  manipulation. 

  The project's ambition is to give developers a set of core
  modules which can be used together or individually to
  support specific SVG solutions. Examples of modules are
  an SVG parser, an SVG generator and an SVG DOM
  implementation. Another ambition of the Batik project is to
  make it highly extensible (for example, Batik allows the
  developer to handle custom SVG tags). Even though the
  goal of the project is to provide a set of core modules, one
  of the deliveries is a full fledged SVG Viewer
  implementation which validates the various modules and
  their inter-operability. 

  In a nutshell, Batik provides building blocks that developers
  can assemble in various ways in their Java technology
  applications to generate, parse, view or convert SVG
  contents. For example, Batik contains a Swing component
  that can add SVG viewing capability to all Java technology
  applications. Batik can also be used to generate SVG on a
  client or on a server, and Batik can convert SVG content
  into other formats such as JPEG or PNG. Batik's goal is to
  make it easy for application developers to handle SVG
  content for various purposes, client-side or server-side.
