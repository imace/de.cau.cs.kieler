 * Abstract class every concrete diagram layouter has to extend. Performs the
 * mapping from the diagram/model to the KLayoutGraph, and further on all the
 * downstream steps to achieve a proper layout.
 * <p/>
 * The concrete instances are responsible for the translation of the editor
 * input model to the KLayoutGraph the actual layout engine is working with, and
 * for the appliance of the changes made to the KLayoutGraph back to the model
 * in the editor.
 * <p/>
 * Concrete DiagramLayouters for a model/editor must register themselves through
 * the <code>kimlDiagramLayouter</code> extension point. All DiagramLayouters
 * published to Eclipse this way are collected with the {@link DiagramLayouters}
 * singleton.
 * <p/>
 * Once you have obtained a concrete DiagramLayouter for your model/editor, you
 * just have to call <code>layout</code> with the object you want to be laid
 * out. That is all.
 * <p/>
 * There is still no proper error handling. This must be addressed on a KIELER
 * basis.

	 * {@link KimlAbstractLayouter#buildLayoutGraph() buildLayoutGraph}, which
	 * must also be implemented by the subclass.</li>
	 * <li>A layout engine is chosen. At the moment, there is just the
	 * {@link KimlRecursiveGroupLayouterEngine}, which spawns a new layout
	 * provider for each hierarchy level. This can be changed in later
	 * implementations.</li>
	 * <li>Finally, {@link KimlAbstractLayouter#applyLayout() applyLayout} of
	 * the implementing class is called to write the information which is now in
	 * the processed KLayoutGraph back to the diagram in the viewer or editor.</li>
