TITLE: Model Execution and Meta Layout in Eclipse
======

ABSTRACT:
=========
KIELER is an open source research project about enhancing the graphical model-based design of complex systems, and focuses on the pragmatics of model-based design in the context of Eclipse and its modeling subprojects EMF and GMF. This talk introduces the aspects of model execution and automatic layout as they are implemented in KIELER.

One aspect is to increase the analysis possibilities of functional models such as state machines or domain specific languages for system design. The first thing required is a common notion about execution of such models and common APIs and user interfaces to trigger, step and trace simulations and other kinds of executions. The Model Execution subproject allows the definition of execution semantics for EMF models in modular and extensible plug-ins. 

A further focus of the KIELER project is the automatic layout of graphical diagrams. The Meta Layout subproject offers extension points for contribution of new layout algorithms, and generically manages the usage and customization of such algorithms in GMF diagram editors. This includes the ability to layout compound structures and data flow diagrams.
