TITLE: Executable Models in Eclipse!
======

ABSTRACT:
=========
KIELER is an open source research project about enhancing the graphical model-based system design of complex systems and focuses on the pragmatics of model-based system design in the context of Eclipse and its modeling subprojects EMF, GEF and GMF.

One aspect is to increase the analysis possibilities of functional models such as state, activity or dataflow diagrams or any such kind in form of domain specific languages. The first thing required is a common notion about execution of such models and common APIs and user interfaces to trigger, step and trace simulations and other kinds of executions.

The Execution Manager sub-project allows allows the definition of execution semantics for e.g., EMF models in modular and extendable Eclipse plug-ins. 

This talk aims the prospects and opportunities that arise from extending EMF models with concrete semantics and provide Eclipse with a flexible way to execute such models.
It shows a colorful example where a domain specific EMF model is visually simulated using the Ptolemy project as one possible example execution back-end engine - all seamlessly integrated within a single instance of the Eclipse Rich Client Platform.
