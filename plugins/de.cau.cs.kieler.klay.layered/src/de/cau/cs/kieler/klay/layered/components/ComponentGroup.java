/**
 * Represents a group of connected components grouped for layout purposes.
 * 
 * <p>A component group is divided into nine sectors as such: (the nine sectors are enumerated in the
 * {@link ComponentGroupSector} enumeration)</p>
 * <pre>
 *   +----+----+----+
 *   | nw | n  | ne |
 *   +----+----+----+
 *   | w  | c  | e  |
 *   +----+----+----+
 *   | sw | s  | se |
 *   +----+----+----+
 * </pre>
 * <p>The port sides of external ports a component connects to determines which sector(s) it will
 * occupy. This is best illustrated by some examples:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Let {@code c} be a component connected to a northern port. Then {@code c} would be placed in
 *       the {@code n} sector.</li>
 *   <li>Let {@code c} be a comopnent connected to a southern port and to an eastern port. Then
 *       {@code c} would be placed in the {@code se}Â sector.</li>
 *   <li>Let {@code c} be a component connected to no port at all. Then {@code c} would be placed in the
 *       {@code c} sector.</li>
 *   <li>Let {@code c} be a component connected to a western and to an eastern port. Then {@code c}
 *       would be placed in the {@code w}, {@code c}, and {@code e} sectors. If {@code c} would also
 *       connected to a southern port, it would also occupy the {@code sw}, {@code sc}, and {@code se}
 *       sectors.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>This placement strategy implies a few restrictions:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The corner sectors may only accommodate at most one component each.</li>
 *   <li>If a component occupies multiple sectors, the restrictions of the most severely restricted
 *       sector applies to all the sectors. That is, if a component occupies multiple sectors of which
 *       one is a corner sector, the other sectors may also only contain one component each, even if
 *       they would usually be able to contain more.</li>
 * </ul>
