\begin{abstract}
Execution Manager is used in KIELER as a framework to plug-in DataComponents for various tasks. Examples are:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Simulation Engines
 \item Model Visualizers
 \item Environment Visualizers
 \item Validators
 \item User Input Facilities
 \item Trace Recording Facilities 
\end{itemize}

These DataComponents can be executed using a graphical user interface (GUI). 
The scheduling order can also be defined by this GUI as well as other settings like a step/tick duration and properties of DataComponents.

In order to make it more comfortable for the user, preference pages for the Execution Manager could offer the following:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Configure a default configuration
 \item Including timeouts, debug level, scheduling, other settings
 \item Make these things specific for a diagram type
 \item Provide a mechanism to access some last used configurations/schedules 
\end{itemize}
