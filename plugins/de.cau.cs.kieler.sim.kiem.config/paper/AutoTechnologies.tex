\chapter{Used Technologies}
\label{chapter:AutoTechnologies}

In addition to the technologies used in the first part of this
thesis (see Chapter \ref{chapter:ConfTechnology}) other Eclipse
technologies will be used as well.

The next sections will describe the technologies and give some
examples of their usage in the standart Eclipse application.
The technologies described here are the following:
\begin{description}
 \item The Job: The Eclipse Job is a mechanism for very long running tasks.
 \item The Wizard: The wizard is a method for helping the user to set up complex tasks.
\end{description}


\section{The Job}
\label{section:AutoTechJob}

The Job API is specifically designed to accommodate very long running
tasks which makes it perfect for our purposes since an execution
run with several model files and hundreds of trace files might
a whole night.
An example for the use of jobs in the normal Eclipse architecture
is the SVN commit operation seen in Figure \ref{fig:SVNCommit}.

\section{Eclipse Wizards}
\label{section:AutoTechWizards}
To allow the user to set up the execution run we will be using the
Eclipse Wizard API.
Wizards are used to guide the user through the process of creating complex items by taking
the information in a structured way and then generating the item from it.
One example inside the Eclipse Architecture is the Java Class Creation Wizard (see Figure \ref{fig:ClassWizard})
In theory it is possible to just open a text file and enter all the information manually.
However if the wizard is used the user only has to select the class he wants to extend
and the interfaces he wants to implement, activate one check box and then the wizard will
create the class body, all required methods and comments for each element (see Listing \ref{fig:classCreationGenerated})
This makes it very easy for even inexperienced users to create new classes without knowing
the exact syntax.

    public MyClass(String id) {
        super(id);
    }

    /**

    @Override
    protected Control createControl(Composite parent) {
        return null;
    }

    /**

    public void run() {
    }

    /**

    public static void main(String[] args) {
    }
}
