\chapter{Code Changes in the Execution Manager}
\label{chapter:AutoKiemChanges}
In order for the \ac{KIEMAuto} to operate successfully there were
no changes necessary beyond the ones described in Chapter \ref{chapter:KiemChanges}. However the 
newly created plug-in uses many of these features and could not achieve its objectives without them.

The \ac{KIEMAuto} makes use of the event listener extension point 
(see Section \ref{section:EventListener}) in order to get 
notified about events occurring during the current execution run. This involves receiving information
about the completion of a step or user- and error-triggered termination or the currently active execution.

It also uses the tool bar contributor extension point (see Section \ref{section:ToolbarContributionProvider})
to add new control elements to the Execution Managers tool bar.
