\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chapter:AutoConclusion}
As stated in Chapter \ref{chapter:AutoTask} the problem consists of four parts:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Find an easy way for the user to set up an automated run.
 \item Input the information provided by the user into the data components.
 \item Design a control flow for an automated run.
 \item Organize the output of the automated run and display it to the user.
\end{enumerate}
The following sections will summarize the results and provide some ideas for
future work.

\section{Results}
\label{section:AutoResults}
\begin{itemize}
 \item setup using the wizard
 \item input using new interfaces
 \item control flow with job mechanism
 \item output using a view with tables and methods to export
\end{itemize}


\section{Further improvements}
\label{section:AutoImprovements}
\begin{itemize}
 \item allow the user to select which columns to export/display
 \item implement macro step support as soon as KIEM does
\end{itemize}
