Modeling utility for the KIELER project. The classes provided in this plug-in
extend the existing modeling frameworks by additional functionality that is
used throughout KIELER. This plug-in depends on the basic modeling frameworks
EMF and GEF, but should be kept free from extended frameworks such as GMF
or Xtend / Xpand.
