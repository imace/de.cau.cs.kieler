<H1>Preferences</H1>
On the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">main preferences page</SPAN>, you can switch between different processors that
use different protocols to communicate with the EvalBench. For the KEP, choose
Kiel ``Kiel Esterel Processor Protocol.'' You must also choose whether you run
the original implementation of the KEP in VHDL, or the reimplementation in
Esterel, since there are minor differences in the assembler. For the software
simulation, only the Esterel KEP is available.

<P>
On the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">connection preferences page</SPAN>, you can choose how to connect to the KEP,
directly with java native interface (JNI), or via TCP/IP for the software
simulation of the KEP, or via serial port to an FPGA. 
When you set the ``log connection'' option, the low level communication
between the KEP and the EvalBench is shown in the connection view.

<P>
On the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">verify preferences page</SPAN>, you can choose benchmarks to run regression
tests on the KEP.
