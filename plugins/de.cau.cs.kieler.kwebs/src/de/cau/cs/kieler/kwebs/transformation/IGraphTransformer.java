/**
 * This interface defines an infrastructure for serialization and deserialization of models 
 * in order to transfer them between a client and the layout web service. The client uses concrete
 * implementations of this interface in order to serialize and deserialize the model to do layout on.
 * The server uses an extension point mechanism to register the supported transformations. Depending on 
 * the format identifier supported by the client when he does a layout request the server acquires a 
 * compatible transformer to derive the model instance from the serialized model and the the graph 
 * structure of the model, represented by a {@code KGraph} instance. After calculating the layout, the 
 * initially derived model instance is applied with the calculated layout before it is being serialized
 * and sent back to the client.
