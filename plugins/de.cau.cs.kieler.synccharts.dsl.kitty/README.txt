\____________________________________________

This is the main plug-in for the textual editor for KIT. KIT is the textual 
SyncCharts language, used in KIEL *not KIELER*. But as we have slightly modified 
the KIT language, its name became "KITTY" to differ between the two versions. 

Thus this plug-in rather had the main purpose of making KIELER 
backwards-compatible, in the means that we can also read old models, written in
KIT.

This plug-in is not supported at the moment.
